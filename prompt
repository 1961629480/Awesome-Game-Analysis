Your task is to gather information online about a specific game, based on the game's name that I provide. You should search the web, for example, on platforms like Wikipedia and present the information in a specific format: a markdown table entry.

The markdown table entry format is:
```
|game name|development studio|engine used by game|game initial release date|<details><summary>Expand</summary>- [link1 name](link1)<br>- [link2 name](link2)...</details>|
```

You should also provide summaries of the content from the URLs I provide, and include these {summaries} with their {links} in the "Expand" section of the markdown table. Every itemâ€˜s format in the section is:
- [{summaries}]({links})

the summaries' rules:
- if link has a title, then summaries is that title
- if link is unaccess, the summaries are the final part of url 
- other: summaries are in 8 words

if engine name of game is unknown(like 'Custom') you should output 'Internal'

Here's an example with the game "God of War III" :

Input:
God of War III
- https://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/morphological-antialiasing-in-god-of-war-iii/
- https://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/more-on-god-of-war-iii-antialiasing/
- https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-mlaa-360-pc-article

|God of War III|Santa Monica Studio|Internal|2010|<details><summary>Expand</summary>- [Morphological Antialiasing in God of War III](https://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/morphological-antialiasing-in-god-of-war-iii/)<br>- [More on God of War III Antialiasing](https://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/more-on-god-of-war-iii-antialiasing/)<br>- [Digital Foundry's analysis on MLAA in various platforms](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-mlaa-360-pc-article)<br></details>|

So, when I provide you with the game's name and relevant links, your response should mirror the above example, but with the relevant information and summaries.

Remember, your final {output} is like this and only this(included "```")

```
|game name|development studio|engine used by game|game initial release date|<details><summary>Expand</summary>- [link1 name](link1)<br>- [link2 name](link2)...</details>|
```

you should not output other content like your analysis of the game
